  <h2>Can I try out an event before joining the club?</h2>
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo4">Answer</button>
  <div id="demo4" class="collapse">
    You can try out an event once before joining the club, but you need to sign a release before doing the event. You can get a release by clicking on join now, then "Click here for membership application". Then download and print out the second page. Sign it and bring it to the event and give it to the event coordinator.

  <div id="demo5" class="collapse">
    You will need a bicycle helmet, a proper maintained bicycle, and a tube in case you get a flat, and also a full water bottle. Optional equipment is a tool kit, tire irons for fixing flat, and a first aid kit.
You also might need to bring a lunch, depending on where the bike ride is located at.
Also check with the event coordinator on the degree of difficulty of the ride. The ride might be hilly or a lot of miles. Or the ride could be easy, and flat and low mileage. Also think about your abilty to do the ride.
